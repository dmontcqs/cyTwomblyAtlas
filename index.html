              From this period, both Untitled and Landscape reflect the
              contemporary art seen in New York. However, the aspects of the
              late 1940s expressionism mix with the cave painting style that has
              its roots in Twombly’s early Lexington days. In these two
              non-figurative paintings, Twombly utilizes a simplistic color
              scheme and linear composition, which give the paintings a
              prehistoric and archaic quality. Each of the paintings has an
              earth-toned palette that makes the black and white linear aspects
              stand out.

              In 1961, Twombly painted School of Athens.Like Untitled (Say
              Goodbye, Catullus, to the Shores of Asia Minor), the title plays a
              crucial part in the understanding of the image. School of Athens
              relates to the 1509 Raphael fresco of the same name. Without
              knowledge of the title, the abstracted formal elements of the
              painting do not blatantly illustrate this reference, similar to
              the relationship between the title and the visual content of the
              1994 work. Twombly found inspiration for his work in literary as
              well as other artistic sources as a way to draw on the idea that
              the basic ideals of humanity permeate throughout history.
              Raphael’s School of Athens illustrates ideas of philosophy,
              poetry, art, and other classical humanistic elements; ideas that
              exist through time. Therefore, Twombly’s reference to this
              Renaissance painting depicts how the basic ideals of humans exist
              throughout history

              Untitled from 1970 (...) illustrate the aesthetic of applying a
              minimal background in order to highlight the figurations included
              in the work as a way to draw attention to them. The size of each
              of these canvases from different decades of Twombly’s career
              demonstrates how the large scale of the backdrop played an
              influential role in his later works. In each work, Twombly paints
              a minimal background in order to ensure the focus lies on the
              other sections of the work, an aspect made possible through the
              use of massive canvases.

              Twombly completed the backdrop shortly after he returned from
              Europe, with the images of actual prehistoric cave drawing and
              archaic forms still fresh in his mind. The simplistic color scheme
              – again, probably consisting of black or dark blue and white –
              recalls Twombly’s early works, such as Untitled from 1951 and
              Tiznit from 1953. Most of his work up to this point had been
              reduced to monochrome. It is not until later that Twombly would
              inject bright colors into his canvases. By reducing the backdrop
              to such simplistic terms, Twombly demonstrates his knowledge of
              allowing art to express emotion.

              Executed between 2003 and 2008, the Bacchus series marks the
              culmination of Twombly’s 50-year painterly practice. Twombly often
              responded to the violence of contemporary political events with
              works that drew on classical history and literature. His paintings
              of Achilles and Troy from the 1960s and 1970s, for example, have
              frequently been interpreted as meditations on the Vietnam War. In
              2003, shortly after the US invasion of Iraq, the then 75-year-old
              Twombly embarked upon what became known as his Bacchus paintings,
              named for the Roman god of winemaking, fertility, madness and
              religious ecstasy. In the catalogue essay that accompanied their
              2005 exhibition, art historian Malcolm Bull argued that the
              abiding theme of these paintings was that of a force of madness
              rising, like a ‘fire that rises from the depths of the sea’.

              Similar to the backdrop, Twombly combines image and text seen in
              his 1983 painting Anabasis (Xenephon). In this painting, he
              includes the name “Anabasis” at the top of the canvas and paints
              an abstracted image underneath. Anabasis refers to the most famous
              book by Xenephon, the ancient Greek writer, and tells the story of
              the Army of Ten Thousand’s expedition, led by Cyrus the Younger,
              from the coastline to the interior of Babylon to capture Persia.
              Even though the battle resulted in a victory for the Greeks, Cyrus
              died in battle, rendering the victory meaningless. Twombly
              utilized text and images to showcase this instance of the
              fleetingness of life. The image below “Anabasis” would lack
              context if not for the inclusion of words on the canvas. Twombly’s
              use of words creates clarity and also adds dimension to the idea
              of expansive human emotions and beliefs

              Twombly divided this painting, which he later titled Untitled (Say
              Goodbye, Catullus, to the Shores of Asia Minor), into three
              sections – not unlike the backdrop, coincidentally. Two panels
              measure 400 cm by 297 cm, and the middle panel measures 400 cm by
              990 cm. The triptych hangs flat against the wall with all the
              panels connected to create a continuous painting. Twombly intended
              for the painting to be read from right to left, starting with the
              more colorful sections and moving towards the black and white
              areas. This specific directional reading also plays in to the
              content of the work. Described in more detail later in the
              chapter, the painting illustrates the story of Catullus leaving
              Asia Minor for his home in Rome. To make this journey, Catullus
              traveled from east to west, or right to left, which Twombly
              emphasizes through the direction of the composition.
